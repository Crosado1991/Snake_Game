Snake Game
This is a simple Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle module.

How to Play
Run the Python script.
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake.
The snake will move continuously in the direction you choose.
Eat the food (represented by a green dot) to grow the snake and earn points.
Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own tail, which will end the game.
Try to achieve the highest score possible!
